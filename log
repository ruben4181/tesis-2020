First Step is to get the images of the areas of interest. Preferably images with the less
cloud covering as possible.

The next step is to apply the pansharpening procces to the images to get the full resolution needed
in the project

Then or parallel at the last step get the nfc files from the images using sentinel tools software
to get the coordinates of all of the pixels in the panchromatic image
